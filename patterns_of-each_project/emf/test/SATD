if there are multiple variables in declaration , separate this variable fragment into a separate declaration
revisit do we really need to support block names as in unicode 3 1 or we can just create all the names in isblockname format \( xml schema rec \) \?
fb wo n't compile with vaj or no jikes fb object adapter adapterfactory adapt \( mapping \)
because of the old factoring approach in the create method , it might be the case that the state of the old value has changed by the time we get here , and in that case , we do n't want to duplicate the removals in this code
todo hack that should be removed
todo deprecate \( since no longer used by geteditpluginclass \( \) , geteditorpluginclass \( \) , gettestsuiteclass \( \) \)
eatm this might be better written as a single loop for the eobject case \?
todo this assumes we only get a set notification , which is n't a good assumption
we should be able to find the comma because the range for enum constants includes all preceding comments up to the previous constant if targetsourcerangecomputer of astrewrite changes , this logic should change to skip comments see org eclipse emf codegen merge java facade ast commentawaresourcerangecomputer getenumconstantsourcerange \( astnode \)
this runs the operation , and shows progress \( it appears to be a bad thing to fork this onto another thread \)
