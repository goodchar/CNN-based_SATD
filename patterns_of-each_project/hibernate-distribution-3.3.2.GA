todo currently expects that the individual with expressions apply to the same sql table join this may not be the case for joined subclass where the property values might be coming from different tables in the joined hierarchy at some point we should expand this to support that capability however , that has some difficulties 1 \) the biggest is how to handle ors when the individual comparisons are linked to different sql joins 2 \) here we would need to track each comparison individually , along with the join alias to which it applies and then pass that information back to the fromelement so it can pass it along to the joinsequence
