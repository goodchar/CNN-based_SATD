the problem we trying to solve below stdin in java is blocked and non interruptible , so if we invoke read on it , we might never be able to interrupt such thread so , we use in available \( \) to see if there is any input ready , and only then read it but this approach ca n't tell whether the end of stream reached or not , so we might end up looping right at the end of the stream well , at least , we can improve the situation by checking if some input was ever available , and if so , not checking for available anymore , and just go to read
