fix up bad figs p due to errors in earlier releases of argouml it can happen that there is a generalization without a child or parent p todo move into xsl we should not remove from the graph model while we 're writing to it or we have a possible cause of concurrent modification exception param owner
our superclass no longer has this method , so perhaps this whole thing should be removed \? tfm super updatelisteners \( newowner \)
delete a model element implements 'cascading delete' to make sure model is still valid after element has been deleted p the actual deletion is delegated to delete methods in the rest of the factories for example a method deleteclass exists on corehelper delete methods as deleteclass should only do those extra actions that are necessary for the deletion of the modelelement itself i e deleteclass should only take care of things specific to umlclass p the delete methods in the uml factories should not be called directly throughout the code ! calls should always refer to this method and never call the deletexxx method on xxxfactory directly the reason that it is possible to call the deletexxx methods directly is a pure implementation detail p the implementation of this method uses a quite complicated if then else tree this is done to provide optimal performance and full compliance to the uml 1 4 metamodel the last remark refers to the fact that the uml 1 4 model uses multiple inheritance in several places this has to be taken into account p todo the requirements of the metamodel could probably be better determined by reflection on the metamodel then each association that a deleted element participates in could be reviewed to make sure that it meets the requirements and , if not , be deleted tfm p extensions and its children are not taken into account here they do not require extra cleanup actions not in the form of a call to the remove method as is normal for all children of mbase and not in the form of other behaviour we want to implement via this operation param elem the element to be deleted see org argouml model umlfactory delete \( java lang object \)

reply true iff this critic is relevant to the goals that the designer is trying to achieve by default , all critic 's are relevant regardless of the goalmodel really this is something for a controlmech to compute , but if a subclass of critic encapsulates some information you may need to override this method p todo i would like a better default action , but goals are typed and their values must be interpreted by critics they are not as generic as the decisionmodel param dsgr the designer return true if relevant

todo implement this !
todo hook this creating of a new resource in to someplace more more appropriate \( perhaps createmodel \( \) \? \) better yet add a new method to model api to create a new top level project model xmi file so we do n't depend on side effects

this is the interface for registering interest in events sent from the model component p neither the registration or unregistration , nor the events themselves contain any reference to the model implementation instead they use the link java beans propertychangelistener , link java beans propertychangeevent to deliver events p the reference to the listener is a weakreference so you do n't need to call removewhateverlistener , you can just forget about your listener and it is eventually finalized and removed this also means that you will have to keep a reference to your listener while it is active since the garbage collecting mechanism is not really deterministic a forgotten about listener might still receive events unless it can handle them in a harmless way , this approach should not be used todo \( is this still true or does it refer to the nsuml implementation \? tfm 20051109 \) \( this is part of the contract that is established between the model subsystem and its users if that is not fulfilled by the current implementation , then the current implementation is incorrect linus 20060411 \) p todo what event names \? the event names generated are link string s and their values and meanings are not really well documented in general they are the name of an an association end or attribute in the uml metamodel p here are some highlights ul li remove event sent when the element is removed ul author linus tolke
return the tagged value with a specific tag p warning this method returns only the first taggedvalue found with the given name hence , this method is a simplification of the real problem and should be avoided todo what should be done about the above problem \? options are to deprecate the method , throw an exception if the name is ambiguous , or leave the caller to figure it out themselves param handle the model element the tagged value belongs to param name the tag name return the found tag , null if not found
translate the visibility flag of a fig to the pgml visibility attribute value the pgml values are 0 hidden and 1 shown if not specified then 1 is the default so we return null for this to prevent redundent data being written to pgml todo remove on gef release after 0 11 9 as it will be provided there param f the fig return 0 hidden , null shown

we hang our heads in shame there are still bugs in argouml and or gef that cause corruptions in the model before a save takes place we repair the model in order to be as certain as possible that the saved file will reload todo split into small inner classes for each fix return a text that explains what is repaired
todo as currently coded , this actually returns all behavioralfeatures which are owned by classifiers contained in the given namespace , which is slightly different then what 's documented it will not include any behavioralfeatures which are part of the namespace , but which do n't have an owner
