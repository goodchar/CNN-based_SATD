# CNN-based_SATD
This is a replication package for our paper submitted in TOSEM: Neural Network Based Classification of Self-admitted Technical Debt: From Performance to Explainability and Deployability

========================================================================

Here are some description of our documents:

1, patterns_of_each_project refers to the h-grams obtained as rationale for each classification extracted from different projects and the classification results of our approach for each of the 62.5K analyzed comments;

2, other_metrics refers to the metrics we do not include in our paper;

3, techinical_debt_dataset refers to the dataset we used;

4, 700patterns refers to the patterns we summarized;

5, comparison with TES 2017 includes some experiments that we make comparison with the approach proposed in "Using natural language processing to automatically detect self-admitted technical debt";

6, Loss_values include the loss values of our approach.
