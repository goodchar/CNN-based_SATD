ok , this is a hack currently , when precision scale , i have no way to determine if this is valid for the actual data the problem comes when the source db 's precision scale are greater or reported to be greater than the precision scale of the destination db in this case , it maximimizes both for the destination , causing a definition that allows 0 digits to the left of the decimal trouble is , without looking at the actual data , there is no way to tell if this is valid in some cases it will be ok \( 0 0000000789 \) in others it will not be ok \( 100 123 \) so for now , make the scale be approx one half of the precision to accomodate the most digits to the left and right of the decimal and hopefully that covers the majority of cases

do n't use tinyint for now , even though mckoi supports it it 's notion of tinyint is 7 bit \( not 8 bit \) so it is not compatible with other dbs and leads to overflow \( resulting in negative values which are a corruption of the actual value inserted updated \) this is not a great work around i filed a bug report on the mailing list hopefully it will get fixed soon
